# ***Colorize Me***
Welcome to ***Colorize Me***, an AI/ML project that takes colorless/grayscale (B&W) images and colorizes them using the Feed-Forward Pass CNN model introduced in [*Colorful Image Colorization*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9_40) (Zhang et al. 2016). It also works on colored images; essentially extracting the louminousity from them to be passed to the CNN for recoloring.
